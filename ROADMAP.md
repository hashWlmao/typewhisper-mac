# Roadmap

## Planned

### Favorite Languages
Mark languages as favorites to surface only those in a quick-access picker for fast switching instead of scrolling through the full list.

### Review before Insert
Editable floating window that shows transcription results before insertion. Recording stops, text appears in a review panel, user can edit, then confirm to insert. Builds on the existing standalone panel pattern (Prompt Palette).
